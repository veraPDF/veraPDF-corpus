# veraPDF Corpus

The repository contains the veraPDF test corpus for PDF/A specifications (Versions 1B, 1A, 2B, 2U, 2A, 3B, 3U, 3A, 4, 4E, 4F), PDF/UA specifications (Versions UA1, UA2), as well as a number of additional tests files for ISO 32000-1.

This test suite complements [Isartor](https://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/isartor-test-suite/ "Isartor test suite") and [BFO PDF/A-2](https://github.com/bfosupport/pdfa-testsuite) test suites and follows their test file pattern:

- all test files are atomic;
- they are self-documented via the document outlines; and
- the naming pattern and the directory structure indicate relevant parts of ISO 19005 (PDF/A), ISO 14289 (PDF/UA) or ISO 32000-1 (PDF 1.7) specification
